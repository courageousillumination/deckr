Goals
=====

See Milestone 2 document. In addition to the features listed there, we plan to implement

* Feature: Spectators.
  * Use case: User would like to watch a game that is in progress.
    * User can select a game room, then select to join as a spectator.
* Feature: YAML definitions for cards.
  * Use case: User would like to define a large number of cards without hard-coding them.
    * User can write the cards into a YAML file and upload this to the server.
* Feature: User feedback from actions.
  * Use case: In some actions we need user feedback before we finish resolving the action.
    * An action can be broken down into steps and each step will either run atomically
      or request more information from the clients.
* Feature: Per user state transitions
  * Use case: Sometimes transitions should only apply to a specific user.
    * The engine will export an interface to get all public transitions and private
      transitions for each player.
* Feature: Leaving the game.
  * Use case: A player wants to leave.
    * A player should be able to leave and be removed from the game. The
      game should respond properly.
* Feature: Improved zones
  * Use case: Sometimes a zone should belong to a player, or have multiple copies.
    * We will expand our zone specification format to allow for ownership and
      multiplicity.
* Feature: Hearts
  * Use case: User would like to play the default implementation of Hearts.
    * User can choose to play the game Hearts on the "new game" page.
* Feature: Dominion
  * Use case: User would like to play the default implementation of Dominion.
    * User can choose to play the game Dominion on the "new game" page.
